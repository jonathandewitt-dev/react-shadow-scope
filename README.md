[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/standard--readme-OK-green.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

```jsx
<Scope stylesheet={styles}>
```

Traditional global CSS risks naming collisions, specificity conflicts, and unwanted style inheritance. Modern tools have been designed to solve these problems by using simulated encapsulation, but nothing can protect from inherited styles except for shadow DOM.

This package does *not* burden you with all the boilerplate around shadow DOM, nor force you to use web components. Did you know you can attach a shadow root to regular elements, like a `<div>`? That's exactly what `react-shadow-scope` does behind the curtain.

> If you're fond of Tailwind, just pass it to each scope. Using Tailwind globally risks naming collisions with other utility classes. This can be especially important for library authors.

As a rule of thumb, you should limit your global CSS to little or nothing. The native `@scope` rule can get you pretty far, but it still doesn't protect from inherited styles. Shadow DOM encapsulation is the *single best tool we have*.

## Install

```
npm i react-shadow-scope
```

## Usage

To create a new CSS scope, import the `Scope` component from the package and just pass a string to the `stylesheet` prop.

> Note: `<Scope>` creates a `<div>` element, but applies `display: contents;` to avoid problems with layouts. (This preserves accessibility because a `<div>` has no semantics to interfere with anyway.)

```jsx
import { Scope } from 'react-shadow-scope';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <>
    {/* Scope gives you protection from inherited styles! */}
    <style>{` #Demo h1 { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; } `}</style>
    <div id="Demo">
      <h1>This title is blue with underline</h1>
      <Scope stylesheet={` h1 { color: red } `}>
        <h1>This title is red without underline</h1>
        <Scope stylesheet={` h1 { font-style: italic } `}>
          <h1>This title is italicized without underline or color</h1>
        </Scope>
      </Scope>
    </div>
  </>
);
```

### Constructed Style Sheets

For better performance, you can create a new `CSSStyleSheet` object and pass it to the `stylesheet` prop.

We export a handy utility function (`css`) that will take care of this for you, while also detecting support and using a fallback when necessary. When rendering on the server, the styles will render in a `<style>` tag.

> For best results, avoid creating a new `CSSStyleSheet` each render.

```jsx
import { useMemo } from 'react';
import { css, Scope } from 'react-shadow-scope';

const MyComponent = () => {

  const styles = useMemo(
    () => css` h1 { color: red } `,
    [],
  );

  return (
    <>
      <Scope stylesheet={styles}>
        <h1>title here</h1>
      </Scope>
    </>
  );
};
```

To use multiple stylesheets, you can also use the `stylesheets` prop (plural) and pass an array.

```jsx
<Scope stylesheets={[theme, styles]}>
```

### Declarative Shadow DOM

If you want to use declarative shadow DOM directly, without the `<Scope>` component, you can use `<Template>`, which adds support to React for the native `<template>` element, with some added features.

```jsx
import { css, Template } from 'react-shadow-scope';

const MyComponent = () => {

  const styles = useMemo(
    () => css`/* css styles here */`,
    [],
  );

  // Note the declarative `adoptedStyleSheets` prop!
  return (
    <card-element>
      <Template
        shadowrootmode="closed"
        adoptedStyleSheets={[styles]}
      >
        <article>
          <header>
            <h3><slot name="heading">(Untitled)</slot></h3>
          </header>
          <div className="body">
            <slot>(No content)</slot>
          </div>
        </article>
      </Template>
      <span slot="heading">Title Here</span>
      <p>Inside Default Slot</p>
    </card-element>
  );
};
```
